It is located at good place so easy to locate. Parking options are not available for 4 wheelers. Two wheelers are fine to stand outside. Delivery option is also available.

If you're planning to visit the place based on tamilnadu hotel..
Please read this before buying biryani
Please be cautious before buying biryani here they are using animal fat in the biryani to reduce oil consumption.. if don't trust me buy any biryani and see u can find this animal fat contents.. for biryani preparation we need oil to reduce that oil quantity if we use fats mostly they use cow fats which is cheap ,once it heated it will secret oil from that fats it more dangerous to our health.. never expected this from tamilnadu hotel.. soldratha solitan apuram unga istam makkaley..."

I was going though such a phase for the past couple of days when I started looking for a place which serves just that, but on a budget. After my workout at night, I fired up a certain restaurant locator app, filtered places that were open at 11 in the night and served exactly what I needed. I stumbled upon this small little place, which I hadn't heard about before.

It's located in a narrow lane with lots of PG accommodations nearby, and quite naturally, people from them become Madurai Cafe's regular customers.

Coming to the food, they serve authentic South Indian fare with Dosas, Idlis, Vadas, Parottas of all variety and kind. Be it chicken, plain, egg they have it all. They put up a board with the speciality if the day mentioned each day. I was probably the last or so customers for the day because of which I lost out on the opportunity to treat myself to more awesome food. Nonetheless the chilli garlic dosa and egg Parotta I ordered were too good. Not too oily, they went well with the coconut and tomato chutney they were served with. The service is prompt, with food being prepared in a jiffy.

Don't expect to have a fine dine here as its a small place with basic stools and tables to accommodate around 5-6 people at a time.

On enquiring with the owner, he said the place opened around 10 months back with him and people making the food being from Madurai. I can certainly say that authenticity of the Madurai food is perfectly reflected in the food here at Madurai Cafe.

The kari and chicken kari are very good. The ceylon parotta, egg veechu and most of the dishes here are good.
They also serve TN style biriyani made off samba rice.
Mutton chukka is very tasty here.

The place has limited seating and might take a while to serve ordered food some times. But the food is really good.

Currently they serve only lunch and dinner."
